# Owner

**Staking pool owners have the following abilities:**

1. Can change the ‘effective interest rate’ of the staking pool at any time.

2. Can set the ‘eligibilityAmount’ of Rookie/Professional staking pools.

3. Can transfer their ownership of the smart contracts to another address.

4. Can renounce ownership of the smart contract, thereby making ‘0x0’ address as the owner. \(Once this is done, the previous owner will not be able to perform any of the above actions and no changes can be done to the smart contracts\).
